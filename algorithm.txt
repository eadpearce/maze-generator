Start with a grid full of unvisited squares.

X X X X X
X X X X X
X X X X X
X X X X X
X X X X X

Pick a random square in the grid. Mark the adjacent squares as walls and add them to the wall list.

starting_pos = (1,1)

X W X X X
W C W X X
X W X X X
X X X X X
X X X X X

wall_list = [(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)]

While there are walls in the list:

  Pick a random wall from the list

  R = (2,1)
  C = (1,1)
  diff = (1,0)
  opposite = R + diff ? = (2,1)+(1,0) = (3,1)

  X W X X X
  W C R X X
  X W X X X
  X X X X X
  X X X X X

  If the square on the opposite side is unvisited:

    Make the wall a cell and make the square on the opposite side a wall.

      X W X X X
      W C C W X
      X W X X X
      X X X X X
      X X X X X

    Make the adjacent squares of the new cell into walls and add them to the wall list.

    new_walls = [(2,0), (3,1), (2,2)]

    X W W X X
    W C C W X
    X W W X X
    X X X X X
    X X X X X

    wall_list = [(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,1), (2,2)]

  Remove the original wall from the list.

  wall_list = [(1,0), (0,1), (1,2), (3,1)]
